### I have made many versions of my personal website before, ranging from using Google Sites (It's horrible btw, don't use it lol), to using the **React** framework. But they all lack many features, like easily updatable blog posts. Now I am going to challenge myself to make the website with all the features I need, and use PURE Webdev (HTML + CSS + JS)

---

The website will contain the following features. I will tick them off once I finish

-   [x] Homepage
-   [x] Updateable Projects Page
-   [ ] About Page
-   [ ] Contact Page
-   [ ] A place to leave messages from visitors
-   [ ] Analytics - e.g unique visitors
-   [ ] _Fun features_

## Home Page

The homepage is designed with flexible cards, which allow it to distribute neatly regardless of the viewport size. This is done through using the awesome display: flex; option of the container, which creates a flexbox that can be customized easily
